QOMET v1.5 (March 2009)
---------------------------

In QOMET v1.5 the focus was not on adding new features, but mainly on
improving the performance of QOMET. As QOMET grew to represent a set
of tools, the meaning of the acronym QOMET was changed to "Quality
Observation adn Mobility Experiment Tools". The process of optimizing
and restructuring QOMET will continue.

Nevertheless, several new features do exist, as follows:
  * New node attribute value:
    - dei80211mr: reproduce the characteristics of the homonymous
      model that enables multi rate simulations in NS-2
  * New object attribute and attribute values:
    - type: specify the type of an object (available choices are
      'builidng' and 'road')
  * Added support for outputing motion data in NS-2 format, for use in
    NS-2 simulations, via the option '-s' of 'qomet'; the option '-m'
    still produces NAM format output
  * The 'do_wireconf' program was made more user friendly by improving
    support for OLSR routing, while retaining also the previous
    flexible configuration features



QOMET v1.4 (September 2008)
---------------------------

In QOMET v1.4, support for new wireless technologies was not
added. However, the existing features were extended so as to allow a
wider range of experiments. For example, 3D environments can now be
represented. In addition, JPGIS map information can be imported and
used as the source of bulding coordinates.

New features:
  * Added several command-line arguments to allow finer control of the
    generated output and of the computation
  * New scenario attributes:
    - coordinate_system: specify the coordinate system used in the
      scenario (available choices are 'cartesian' and
      'latitude/longitude/altitude' systems)
    - jpgis_filename: specify the name of the JPGIS file from which
      object coordinates are to be loaded (UTF-8 encoding is
      required)
    - motion_step_divider: divider that should be applied to deltaQ
      calculation step; used for motion computations, so that motion
      time step can be sufficiently small to produce correct
      results, independently on the deltaQ calculation step
  * New node attributes and values:
    - s_node: value of attribute 'adapter', used to emulate S-NODE
      active tag devices
    - elevation_orientation: antenna orientation in elevation
      (vertical) plane in degrees
    - elevation_beamwidth: antenna beamwidth in elevation (vertical)
      plane in degrees
  * New object attributes:
    - height: specify the height of a (3D) object
    - load_from_jpgis_file: specify that object coordinates should
      be loaded from a JPGIS file
    - make_polygon: specify that the object should be considered as
      a polygon by connecting its last and first vertices
  * Added a new element, coordinate, used to represent the 2D
    coordinates of a building contour as it could be seen on a
    map. The object attribute height can be used to construct a 3D
    object.
  * New motion attributes and attribute values:
    - rotation: new value for 'type' attribute that specifies a node
      should rotate at its present position, thus changing its
      antenna orientation; both rotations in horizontal and vertical
      planes are supported
    - rotation_angle_horizontal: new attribute specifying the
      rotation angle in horizontal plane
    - rotation_angle_vertical: new attribute specifying the
      rotation angle in vertical plane
  * New connection attribute values:
    - auto_connect: new value for 'to_node' attribute; can be used
      to indicate that the from_node should be automatically
      connected to all the node in the scenario that were defined up
      to that point in the scenario
    - "smart_tag" value of attribute 'standard' was renamed to
      "active_tag"


QOMET v1.3 (March 2008)
-----------------------

QOMET v1.3 is the forth release of the emulation tool. In addition to
802.11a/b/g and Ethernet network emulation capabilities, QOMET now
supports active tag emulation and ZigBee.

New features:
  * Added support for active tag communication
  * Added support for ZigBee communication
  * New scenario attributes:
    - start_time: specify starting time in seconds (can be negative)
  * New node attribute value:
    - jennic: value of attribute 'adapter', used to emulate JENNIC
      ZigBee devices
    - azimuth_orientation: antenna orientation in azimuth
      (horizontal) plane in degrees
    - azimuth_beamwidth: antenna beamwidth in azimuth (horizontal)
      plane in degrees
  * New motion attributes and values:
    - behavioral: value of attribute 'type', specify the use of
      behavioral model for motion generation
    - destination_x, destination_y, destination_z: specify the
      destination for motion for linear or behavioral models
  * New connection attributes and values:
    - to_node attribute can now take a list of nodes spearated by
      space to specify multiple receiving nodes
    - smart_tag: value of attribute 'standard' used to specify
      active tag connections
    - zigbee: value of attribute 'standard' used to specify ZigBee
      connections
    - consider_interference: specify whether interference between
      nodes is to be taken into account when computing communication
      conditions
  * A new library called 'routing' was introduced to facilitate routing
    calculation
  * A new library called 'chanel' was introduced to facilitate
    experiments with non-IP networks, such as active tags or ZigBee
  * Automatic scenario generation was implemented
  * QOMET output is now also written in binary format, therefore in
    addition to .out files, .bin files will also be produced after running
    QOMET
  * To facilitate display of motion, QOMET creates a mobility trace in
    NAM format (NS-2 Network Animator); files have the extension .nam


QOMET v1.2 (September 2007)
---------------------------

QOMET v1.2 is the third release of the emulation tool and it has now
802.11a/b/g and Ethernet network emulation capabilities.

New features:
  * Improved model of WLAN, using an equation based on
    receiver-sensitivity thresholds (available from most
    manufacturers), and that includes effects of noise
  * Added support for 802.11a, thus permitting complete emulation of
    802.11 WLANs
  * Added support for 802.11g stations operating in compatibility mode
    (i.e., when in the presence of 802.11b stations)
  * New node attributes:
    - adapter: select a parametrized model from the various WLAN
      adapters supported (Cisco Aironet 802.11a/b/g, Cisco Aironet 340,
      ORiNOCO 802.11b)
    - antenna_gain: specify the tranceiver antenna gain in dBi
  * New connection attribute
    - channel: used to model interference between nodes that
      operate in the same area; if nodes operate on the same channel
      interference is highest, and it decreases as the channel
      separation increases
  * Background noise and noise caused by inter-channel interference
    are both included in the model for calculating frame error rate
  * Intra-channel interference is taken into account through the use
    of an analytical model (proposed by Gupta)
  * A new library, wireconf, was introduced, which makes it easy to
    configure a wired-network emulator and run a QOMET emulation
    experiment. At the moment only dummynet on FreeBSD is
    supported. Wireconf is accompanied by a timer library, that ensure
    that dummynet configuration is changed at accurate time
    intervals. The timer library also is only available for FreeBSD so
    far.
    
Changes compared to previous version:
  * The attribute 'fixed_delay' of the 'node' element was renamed to
    'internal_delay', which better reflects the meaning of this
    attribute


QOMET v1.1 (February 2007)
--------------------------

QOMET v1.1 is the second release of the emulation tool and it has now
802.11g and Ethernet network emulation capabilities as well. In
addition objects (obstacles) can be defined and the communication
environment can be computed dynamically so as to increase the realism
of emulation.

New features:
  * Define the SSID for nodes, so that they can connect only to some
    networks 
    - New node properties: ssid
  * Added a new element, object, which allows creation of topologies
    in which nodes can move 
    - Objects can only have rectangular shape
    - Environments are associated to objects; these environments can
      be used to dynamically determine the communication conditions
      for a connection depending on the position of the connected
      nodes and the objects between them
    - Full list of object properties: name, environment, x1, y1,
      x2, y2
  * The environment associated to a connection can be computed in a
    dynamic manner if its attribute "is_dynamic" is set to "true"
    - New environment properties: is_dynamic
  * Added the random-walk motion type
    - New motion properties: min_speed, max_speed, walk_time
  * Added support for 802.11g and Ethernet connections
    - New connection properties: standard, RTS_CTS_threshold
  * User can now specify the bandwith, loss rate and delay & jitter
    associated to a connection. This is particularly useful for
    defining the conditions of Ethernet connections
  * The average number of retransmissions of a frame is now outputted
    as well under the column "num_retr"


QOMET v1.0 - Initial release (October 2006)
-------------------------------------------

QOMET v1.0 is the first release of the WLAN emulation tool. It makes
it possible to build simple scenarios involving WLAN nodes and compute
the network quality degradation effects that correspond to these
scenarios. Subsequently the computed results can be used to reproduce
the effects in a real wired-network environment.
